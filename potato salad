Jimmy's Potato salad 

Ingredients:

    2 pounds of organic potatoes (e.g., Yukon Gold or red potatoes)
    1 cup of mayonnaise
    1/4 cup dijon mustard
    2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
    1 medium onion, finely chopped
    2 celery stalks, finely chopped
    4 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
    Salt and pepper to taste
    Optional: 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley, paprika, or chopped pickles
    Optional: chives

Instructions

    Prepare the Potatoes:
        Wash the potatoes thoroughly and boil them in salted water until they are tender but not falling apart, about 15 to 20 minutes depending on their size.
        Once cooked, drain and let them cool slightly. If preferred, you can peel the potatoes, or leave the skins on for extra texture and nutrients. Cut the potatoes into bite-sized chunks.

    Mix the Dressing:
        In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, mustard, and apple cider vinegar. Stir well to create a smooth dressing.

    Combine the Ingredients:
        In a medium-large bowl, place the chopped potatoes, onion, celery, and eggs. Pour the dressing over the top and gently mix everything together until the potatoes are well coated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

    Chill and Serve:
        Cover and refrigerate the potato salad for at least an hour to allow the flavors to meld together. This salad tastes best when it's cool and the flavors have had time to develop.

    Final Touches:
        Before serving, sprinkle with chopped parsley for a fresh touch and a dash of paprika for color. If you like a bit of crunch or extra tang, you can also add chopped pickles.
